Digital image based Simulation Toolbox DigiSim is an open source software package for digital image processing
based micromechanical Simulation. It is an easy, user-friendly and ready-to-use software developed using Matlab. 
The main object of this code is to model the micromechanical behavior of heterogeneous material based on the image
captured by CT, MRI or digital camera. Both FEM and DEM model can be generated using DigiSim package. 
Besides, it also can be employed to extract the microstructure of material like inclusions, pores and cracks.
